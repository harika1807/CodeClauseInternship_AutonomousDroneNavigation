# 🚁 Autonomous Drone Navigation using Deep Q-Learning

![Project Banner](banner.png)

This project focuses on building an AI system that allows a drone to **navigate autonomously**, avoid obstacles, and reach predefined destinations using **Deep Reinforcement Learning** techniques.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- 🎯 **Aim:** Enable a drone to navigate through an environment using intelligent decision-making powered by Deep Q-Learning.
- 🧠 **Approach:** Use computer vision and reinforcement learning to simulate navigation.
- 🧪 **Simulator Used:** OpenAI Gym's `CartPole-v1` (as a stand-in for drone behavior).

---

## 🧠 Features

- Intelligent agent using a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**
- Learns from environment feedback (reward system)
- Target network synchronization
- Epsilon-greedy policy for balanced exploration/exploitation
- Easily extendable to real drone environments (e.g., AirSim)
